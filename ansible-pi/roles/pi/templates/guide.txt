## welcome to the oasis commune

it's a small pi we're living in here so there's not a ton of space but could be a good place to settle down once global warming sends the human race to live underground

feel free to sign the guestbook, roam the paths, and leave files of your own to help make this pi feel a little more like home


## getting around

you can navigate around oasis using the following commands
to run each command, type the command, and then press enter

commands:
look (how to look around) or type ls
move <name of folder> (how to move into a room) or type cd
back (how to move backwards out of a room) or type cd ..
see <name of file> (how to see a file) or type cat
where (to see what folder you are in) or type pwd


you can also use any standard terminal command (cd, ls, cat, etc.)

to edit files you will need to use vim. vim is complicated for beginners, but this might help:
vim <filename> (to open a file in vim)
press i to enter insert mode
… type what you need
press esc to exit insert mode
press ":w" then enter, to save your changes
press ":q" then enter, to quit vim


if you get lost at any point, try one of these commands:
guide (brings up this guide)
map (brings up a map of oasis)
commands (just brings up a list of helpful commands)
